<h2>
My name is Mary Kate Skitka. I have two siblings. A sister who is 6 years older than me and a brother 8 years older. My family is pretty cool. I like sushi, and crying from laughing. I go to Tufts University and I hope to major in Computer Science and Brain and Cognitive Science. I hope to work in the field of HCI or affective computing. I love quidditch and reading and the outdoors.
I'm excited to learn about web development this semester.
